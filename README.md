### Description <a name="description"></a>  
  Welcome to Read Red & White, a book and reviewer App! This application not only allows you to write and share your reviews about the books you've read but also lets you pair them with the perfect wine selection. Whether you're delving into the depths of a gripping novel or sipping on a fine glass of wine, this app provides you with a platform to express your thoughts and enhance your reading experience with the perfect beverage.

### Installation

Within the db (database) folder, open the .env.EXAMPLE file and enter 'root' for DB_USER='' and 'MySql Root Password' for DB_PASSWORD='.'  Remove the '.EXAMPLE' from the end of the .env file.  This will protect the database, MySQL username, and MySQL password to an environmental variable file and connect to a database using Sequelize.  For installing dependencies, run "npm i" within the terminal of the main directory.  Create the schema from the MySQL shell by running "mysql -u root -p" within the terminal.  Enter 'MySQL ROOT Password' for "Enter password:."  Once connected, source the schema.sql with "source db/schema.sql;" inside of MySQL.  This will create the development database.  Enter "Quit" to end the MySQL connection.  Then, seed the database by running "npm run seed."
